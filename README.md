MishnaBase

This is the database of Mishnaic disputes and constituant disputes used in our Kazhdan and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/benjaminkay/home">Kay</a>  (R&R at JSIJ) working paper.\* 

In addition to downloading the database here on <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminKay/MishnaBase/">github</a>, you can see the database in action: <a href="https://mishnabase.glitch.me/">here</a>. 


Broadly speaking, our database is like the US Supreme Court database  and similar databases of other apex courts. These databases are widely used by legal scholars who wish to make claims about broad trends in judicial decisions (Weinshall and Epstein 2020). The Supreme Court database includes, inter alia, (a) information on which Supreme Court justices are involved in a decision, (b) the direction of the justices’ opinions (e.g., pro- or anti-defendant), and (c) which justices prevail. Our respective analogy for the Mishnah is to code (a) which Tannaim are involved in a decision, (b) the direction of the Tanna’s opinions (e.g., strict or lenient), and (c) which Tanma prevails.  We manually went through the Mishnah, coded every argument along the various parameters described above, and then used computers to collate the data to show who argues with whom and what attitudes they tended to take in these arguments. 

For a detailed discussion of the methodology with which we assembled this database, please see appendix A of our paper.
